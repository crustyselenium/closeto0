# closeto0

This creates and attempts to train a reinforcement learning neural network to play the "Close to Zero" game

# The Game

Close to Zero is very simple, six random numbers are read out one at a time in the order they were generated in. Each time a number is called, the player will place it in an array with 2 rows and 3 columns. Each row will concatenate into a whole number and the difference is found between them. The goal of the game is to get the difference as low as possible.

# Description

Written in Python.
This recurrent neural network, written from scratch, attempts to play Close to Zero optimally.

# Project Status

Currently in active development.
